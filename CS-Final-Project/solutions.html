            There are large, scaleable, mitigation measures for climate change like carbon farming, carbon tax, and so on. However, some argue that these solutions are being hindered by societal and economic factors. Take Jonathan Park for example, an author from Columbia University, who argues that certain aspects of Capitalism help to worsen this problem in his paper Climate Change and Capitalism. For instance, Park analyzes the cost-benefit consumer model that is one of the fundamentals of Capitalism which states that, in an ideal world, people weigh the cost of something against the benefit that it would bring. Park argues that this cost-benefit analysis makes environmental policy very difficult to implement because there isn’t direct monetary value to climate change. This is because to weigh the benefits of regulation against the costs, one would need to know the monetary value of preventing the extinction of species, preserving many different ecosystems, avoiding all manner of serious health impacts, and even saving human lives. Without such numbers, cost-benefit analysis cannot be conducted (Park 6). Park argues that because fossil fuels are extremely cheap, people don’t put as much thought into more expensive alternative forms of energy because they don’t see a monetary benefit. Your average consumer won’t, and can’t, go to the gas station and calculate the long term monetary costs of filling up their sedan. Furthermore, because it is difficult to see a monetary benefit of using sustainable energy, it can make policy making more difficult.

            Park uses Australia’s Carbon Tax, which was implemented in 2012 but repealed in 2014 as an example. Park argues that Australia's initiative, which would lower emissions, failed “because the economic cost outweighed the perceived environmental benefits” (Park 6). The Australian Prime Minister cited the Institute for Energy Research which outlined the costs, including a $4.38 billion loss on the part of the government, as a reason for repealing the policy. Simply put, in the short time that Australia had this policy, there was little monetary or material benefit to the policies, largely because the tax was targeted at .02% of businesses, which caused negative views on the policy as a mitigating solution. The .02% of businesses was too small of a target to reveal any significant environmental or economic benefits of the tax while it cost the government a very large amount of money. Park believes that Capitalism inherently worsens climate change and simply limits our ability to create and implement sustainable solutions.

            However, while Park’s analysis of the cost-benefit model as a hindrance on climate change solutions could fit correctly with your average consumer, this same cost-benefit model may actually help as we look at large corporations who are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, his assumption that the Carbon Tax does not work, simply because it failed in Australia, is also false. Large corporations and businesses inherently weigh the cost and benefit of their economic decisions more thoroughly than an average person in order to maximize their potential profits. According to recent studies, 71% of greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 can be traced back to 100 of these large corporations like ExxonMobil or Chevron (Riley 1). Companies choose to use fossil fuels because they’re substantially cheaper than sustainable alternatives.
